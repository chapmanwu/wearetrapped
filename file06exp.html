        <h6>we don't like it here evolution generally means that a species adapts to its environment but we don't seem to want to play that game a big part of the theory comes down to the fact that we've altered the planet to fit us rather than the other way round we just can't seem to bear living in the natural world the fact that we have altered our environment so drastically makes it seem as though that we're just not suited to living in the Earth's natural habitat in fact what we're doing appears not to be evolving so much as terraforming</h6>
